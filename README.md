Hello, I'm Swapnil Srivastava!<br />

I hold a master's in Data Science from TU Dortmund, NRW Germany, and currently actively seeking job opportunities in India.

I have successfully written my master's thesis on "Identifying anomalies in the Insurance world to improve audit processes" in Munich Re, as a scholarship opportunity. I was also the 1st runner-up among 15+ International teams in a Datathon organized by COST FINTECH and AI in Finance for my study on "Gender diversity in opening an account at a financial institution."

I am a data science enthusiast, having 4+ years of enriching experience (including 1+ years in Germany and three years in India) in areas like Data modeling using statistics and R & python programming language, data visualization using ELK and Power BI, automation using CI/CD pipelines using VSTS. An effective communicator with good relationship-building and interpersonal skills and a positive attitude toward learning and developing knowledge of new technical skills.
